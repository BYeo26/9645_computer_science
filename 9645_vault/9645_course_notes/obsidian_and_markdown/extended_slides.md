# Enhanced Slides
[Extended Slides](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended) is a plugin for obsidian which allows us to quickly create slides in markdown.

## How to use Enhanced Slides

Making a slide is as simple as putting some content (such as a title and some text) and following this with a horizontal rule or line by putting three hyphens or dashes like this: `---`

the three dashes `---` signifies the end of a slide. It's as simple as that

**markdown** can be used as normal in slides and will work and be rendered effectively.
> Direct quotes might be useful

``` python
print("as are code sections")
```
