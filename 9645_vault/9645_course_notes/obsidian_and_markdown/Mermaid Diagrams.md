*Mermaid* diagrams can be used in obsidian and other software to draw diagrams and other things with code, they can be very useful to quickly show some data.

``` mermaid
%%{init: {"pie": {"textPosition": 0.5}, "themeVariables": {"pieOuterStrokeWidth": "5px"}} }%%
pie showData title Programming without Planning
    "Debugging" : 80
    "Programming" : 15
    "Planning" : 5
```
``` mermaid
%%{init: {"pie": {"textPosition": 0.5}, "themeVariables": {"pieOuterStrokeWidth": "5px"}} }%%
pie showData title Programming with Planning
    "Debugging" : 20
    "Programming" : 40
    "Planning" : 40
```
Mermaid Diagrams are an easy way to get various visualisations into obsidian notes.
