Obsidian is a [[markdown]] editor and viewer, it allows you to write markdown notes and presents them in a beautiful way as well as allowing for connections between notes.

Obsidian is a non-linear note taker, notes are arranged in a graph of connections, notes can be tagged, have bookmarks, contain links to websites, contain images, formatting and other things with ease.

Obsidian is how we will keep our notes organised for this course, and you can keep your notes up to date using [[git]]

Obsidian uses [[markdown]] notation to format text, it has a special markdown tag that is used to denote links between markdown documents. To link two documents, or to link to a document which has yet to be made, simply enclose a related word with double square brackets like this example `[[some other page]]` this would link you to a page called 'some other page'

Obsidian also has a great **Graph View** which can be used to see the non-linear connections between notes. You can also filter notes by **path** (directory where notes are stored) or by **tags**

Obsidian also allows for third party plugins to be installed, allowing features such as [[mermaid_diagrams]] to be used, Slides, LATEX or other plugins.
