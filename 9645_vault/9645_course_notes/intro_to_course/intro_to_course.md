# Your Syllabus

You are studying the Oxford AQA 9645 International A Level Computer Science specification!

[[oxfordaqa_a-level_computer_science_specification.pdf]]

---
# Assessment

There will be four examinations at the end of your course:

---
## CS01

### Programming 

- Worth 20% of the final grade. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- 2 hours <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- On-screen exam <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note: this exam covers procedural/imperative programming, working with data structures and algorithms (e.g. stack, queue, bubble sort) and reading/writing serial (text) files.

---
## CS02

### Concepts and Principles of Computer Science

- Worth 20% of the final grade. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- 1 hour 30 minutes <!-- element class="fragment" -->****
- Written exam <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note: covers assembly language programming, data representation, hardware/software etc.

---

## CS03

### Advanced Programming

- Worth 30% of the final grade. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- 2 hours 30 minutes. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- On-screen exam. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note: this exam covers object-oriented programming (OOP) and advanced data structures and algorithms such as tree and graph traversal.

---

## CS04

### Advanced Concepts and Principles of Computer Science

- Worth 30% of the final grade. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- 1 hour 30 minutes <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Written exam <!-- element class="fragment" -->

	note: covers functional programming, database, AI, theory of computation and networks

---

## NEA?

No NEA! <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Internally set and asssessed **Personal Programming Project** (Term 3 this year) instead. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

note: As communicated last year - there is no NEA component to the new international course. 

_However_ : we will be asking to to work on your own personal programming project at the end of Year 12.

- This will be a chance to work on a 'big' project combining a number of programming skills e.g. software design, programming paradigms, client-server, database, GUI programming, networking.

- You have the freedom to explore beyond the constraints/demands of the course if you are up for a challenge e.g. blockchain, neural networks, low-level hardware programming etc.

- This will be invaluable for your university applications,  whether or not you intend to further your study of CS after you leave the school.

_More information on this will follow in due course, as the first two terms will focus on teaching you the skills to program a 'big project'_

# 9645 (IAL) vs. 7517 (UK spec)

Similar to last year's IGCSE, you can/should use the UK A Level 7517 syllabus resources. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

3.16 Artificial intelligence is completely new in your course. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

4.8 Consequences of uses of computing has been dropped from the UK course. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

## Way of Working:

- Two teachers - Mr. Hall, Mr. Davies <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- (mostly) uniform approach <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- VS Code, Live Share <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Git, GitHub, Obsidian <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Hopefully: no Microsoft Word, no OneDrive - yay! <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- However: please still communicate + collaborate making use of MS Teams. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## MLD Topics:

- A Git, GitHub and Obsidian Workflow <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Assembly Language Programming <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## CAH Topics:

- Object Oriented Programming <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Databases <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Data Structures <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Algorithms <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## Today's Task

- Random pairs. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- One Windows machine per pair. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Pair programming last year's CS01 exam. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Our aim: be proud of your *excellent* IGCSE results and gain confidence about how much of the IAL syllabus you are already competent with. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
