## Assessment

There will be four examinations at the end of your course:

---
# CS01

## Programming

- Worth 20% of the final grade.
- 2 hours
- On-screen exam

note: this exam covers procedural/imperative programming, working with data structures and algorithms (e.g. stack, queue, bubble sort) and reading/writing serial (text) files.

---
# CS02

## Concepts and Principles of Computer Science

- Worth 20% of the final grade.
- 1 hour 30 minutes
- Written exam

---

# CS03

## Advanced Programming

- Worth 30% of the final grade.
- 2 hours 30 minutes.
- On-screen exam.

note: this exam covers object-oriented programming (OOP) and advanced data structures and algorithms such as tree and graph traversal.

---

# CS04

## Advanced Concepts and Principles of Computer Science

- Worth 30% of the final grade.
- 1 hour 30 minutes
- Written exam

---

## NEA?

No NEA!

Internally set and asssessed **Personal Programming Project** (Term 3 this year) instead.

note: As communicated last year - there is no NEA component to the new international course. 

_However_ : we will be asking to to work on your own personal programming project at the end of Year 12.

- This will be a chance to work on a 'big' project combining a number of programming skills e.g. software design, programming paradigms, client-server, database, GUI programming, networking.

- You have the freedom to explore beyond the constraints/demands of the course if you are up for a challenge e.g. blockchain, neural networks, low-level hardware programming etc.

- This will be invaluable for your university applications,  whether or not you intend to further your study of CS after you leave the school.

_More information on this will follow in due course, as the first two terms will focus on teaching you the skills to program a 'big project'

# 9645 (IAL) vs. 7517 (UK spec)



---

## Way of Working:

- Two teachers - Mr. Hall, Mr. Davies
- (mostly) uniform approach
- VS Code, Live Share
- Git, GitHub, Obsidian
- Hopefully: no Microsoft Word, no OneDrive - yay!

---

# MLD Topics:

- A Git, GitHub and Obsidian Workflow
- Assembly Language Programming

---

# CAH Topics:

- Object Oriented Programming
- Databases
- Data Structures and Advanced Data Structures
- Algorithms and Advanced Algorithms

---

# Today's Task

- Random pairs
- One Windows machine per pair
- Pair programming last year's CS01 exam
- Our aim: be proud of your *excellent* IGCSE results and gain confidence about how much of the IAL syllabus you are already competent with.
