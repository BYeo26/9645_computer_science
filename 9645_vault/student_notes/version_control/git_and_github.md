# wow git and github notes
## Git
- git is for version control
- it allows us to keep work in versions 👍👍👍
- it saves changes as *diffs*

## How to stage, commit, and push from terminal
```shell
git stage . #preperations (. means regex (anything and everything))
git stage [name of file]

git commit -m "whatever you want to say" #help to show what you did (notes to self)

git push #take local version and push it to the remote version
```
